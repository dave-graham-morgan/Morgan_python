Welcome to Satellite tracker!  Satellite tracker will allow you to enter in an address or lat long and select a number of satellites.
Once you set an address and select at least one satellite, the system will calculate a number of upcomming 'viewings' where you will be able to see the selected satelit(s) transit your location. 

Light pollution and weather at your location may make some satellites difficult or impossible to see.  Some satellites may not be visibile during the evening at your lattitude. Brightest satellites are bluewalker 3 and the ISS which are both available to track and a good place to start. 

To get started clone repo and built venv from requirements.txt.
create a .env file based on the .env.example file.
